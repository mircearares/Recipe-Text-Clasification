Pass them once through the coarse blade of a meat grinder . In a large bowl , mix together the ground pork and fat with the garlic , salt , pepper , cayenne , thyme , paprika , bay leaf , sage , and hickory smoke . A wooden spoon works well . Cut the casing into 26 inch lengths and tie a small knot in one end of each . Fit the open end over the tip of the sausage stuffer and slide it on until the tip of the stuffer touches the knot . The casing will look like accordion folds . This keeps excess air from getting into the casings . Fit the stuffer onto the meat grinder or according the directions that come with the stuffer , or hold the wide end of the stuffer against or over the opening by hand . Fill the hopper with the sausage mixture . Turn the machine on if it is electric and feed the stuffing gradually into the hopper ; for a manual machine , push the stuffing through with a wooden pestle . The sausage casing will fill and inflate gradually . Stop filling about 1 1/4 inches from the funnel end and slip the casing off the funnel , smoothing out any bumps carefully with your fingers and being careful not to push the stuffing out of the casing . Tie off the open end of the sausage tightly with a piece of string or make a knot in the casing itself . To cook , slice the sausage into half-inch rounds and grill in a hot skillet with no water for about 12 minutes on each side , or until brown and crisp at the edges . "
